This is a project for the MSD (Microcontroller Based System Design) Lab, which is taken in AUST in 3rd year 2nd semester. We are building a system whrer anyone can control their home light/fan with their android smart phone from anywhere around the wrold. We have also implemented PIR sensor, which detects movement and automatically turn the light on.
